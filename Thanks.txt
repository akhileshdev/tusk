Hello Navin,

I am watching your videos on youtube and found it very helpful.

Gone through the git tutorial for beginners playlist, it was good.
could you please add some videos of git using comandline ?

You explain beautifully and its very easy to understand.
Thanks for making videos like these.

Regards
Akhilesh Kumar
